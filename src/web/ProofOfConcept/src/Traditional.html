<p>Data is often presented to management in commonly used Excel formats based on structured data portions.
	While these formats are effective at communicating the big picture view of the data, they do not provide a detailed view of the root causes for trends and patterns.</p>

	While the growth is clearly represented, there is nothing to explain the reason behind the growth.  When management asks "Why?", the structured data is unable to provide an answer.</p>
